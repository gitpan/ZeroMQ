Changelog for Perl module ZeroMQ.

0.02_03 Tue Dec 28 2010 21:40 JST
  - Rework the internals to allow high level API (perl-ish, OO) and
    low level API (straight portof zeromq C binding), thanks to jrockway
  - Remove PollItem in favor of getsockopt + ZMQ_FD. Holler if you need it back

0.02_02 Sat Oct 30 2010 21:20 JST
  - Update to work with zeromq2 master (as of 10/28)
  - Added new constants
  - ZMQ_POLLIN callbacks used to pass the ZeroMQ::Message argument
    to the callback function, but this is error prone, so now the callback
    does not receive anything

0.02_01 Mon Sep 06 2010 19:20 JST
  - Releasing a dev release to get some test coverage
  - Add zmq_poll support via ZeroMQ::PollItem
  - Lots of doc fixes
  - Lots of test fixes
  - For people cloning from github, tell them what Module::Install
    modules you need to install
  - Loudly tell the user that you're going to get a blocking socket
    even if you send a SIGINT/SIGTERM while it's in recv().
    This is a problem in libzmq, and it is planned to be fixed on
    libzmq 2.1.x

0.02  Sat Aug 22 2010 09:00 JST
  - Changes from 0.01_01 to 0.02 were tested against zeromq-2.0.7
  - Implement version()
  - Be more paranoid about getting an invalid object (with a
    bad struct)
  - House cleaning, and release a new version!

0.01_03  Thu Aug 20 2010 21:00 JST
  - Fake ZMQ_PULL and ZMQ_PUSH, which were introduced in git, but not in
    the released version
